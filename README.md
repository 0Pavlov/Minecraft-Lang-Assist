# Minecraft-Lang-Assist
Small Python script that designed to help with manual translation of Minecraft mods lang files

# Purpose
To make life easyer when it comes to translaition of a minecraft mod. In situations when you have alot of items\titles in the .json file it's really hard to keep track of lines and u have to double-check if u miss something or not, along with that u spend time to navigate the file using mouse or other device.

Made it for myself after having fun time translaiting some furniture mode to Russian. Also that's my first useful project during my Python learning jorney.

# How to use
  
  - Since it's not converted to any universal executable format you need to have Python interpeter installed on your device.

### PC: Python itself, any IDE that supports Python

### Android: PyDroid3
  
  - Extract the lang file from the mod archive\folder.
  
  - Place the file to the same folder as script in (replace the test file).
(For files that have different name from en_us.json you have to replace file name in the script manually).
  
  - Start script (it will ask u what to do with each name-component of the file).
  
  - After u done, it will rewrite the file according to your changes.
